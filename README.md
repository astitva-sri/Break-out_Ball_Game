# Break-out_Ball_Game
 In this Project i have developed a Breakout-Ball game. In this game, there is a layer of bricks lines that covers the top third of the screen, a ball, and a paddle. A paddle moves horizontally to bounce the ball back upward keeping it playing. When a ball collides with a brick, it bounces back and destroys the brick. The player loses a turn when the ball touches the bottom of the screen. The goal is to break all the bricks without missing the ball. Here we have implemented basic knowledge of Java Swing and OOPS concepts to make this project.
